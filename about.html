        <p><span class="mess">A beautiful mess</span> in my world describes a girl who is imperfectly undone and is happy
            with it. My definition of mess means that I am willing to improve and progress and when I fail I am kind enough
            to accept myself and move on.</p>
        <p>Education</p>
        <p>I am currently at <em>Moringa School</em> doing <strong>Software Development</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Why Moringa School</strong>: I chose Moringa not only because of its quality education but also because
            of its culture and community. Studying here so far has been an amazing experience.</p>
        My expectations:
        <ul>
            <li> JavaScript
            <li>CSS
            <li> jQuery
            <li> HTML
        </ul>
        <p>My favourite things to do are:
                <ol>
                    <li> Travel
                    <li> Binge watch
                </ol>
